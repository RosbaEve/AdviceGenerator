## Overview

### The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this advice generator app using the [Advice Slip API](https://api.adviceslip.com) and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Generate a new piece of advice by clicking the dice icon

## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS 
- Javascript 


### What I learned

I rehearsed the use of an API and got to know the fetch method. 
I learned to present the information from the API when the window loads. 
I also learned about CSS media query method. I will need to familiarize myself with this topic when going forward. 


### Continued development

I'm going to focus on building responsive layout and get to know more about different CSS properties. I am going to start the next project with mobile first approach.
